immutable object
from collections import namedtuple

Point = namedtuple("Point", "x, y")

a = Point(1,3)

print a.x, a.y
Because Point is now immutable your problem just can't happen, but the draw-back is naturally you can't e.g. just add +1 to a, but have to create a complete new Instance.

x,y = a
b = Point(x+1,y)

building all
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29888046/django-1-8-create-initial-migrations-for-existing-schema

Finally got it to work, although I don't know why and I hope it will work in the future.
After doing numerous trials and going through Django's dev site (link).
Here are the steps (for whoever runs into this problem):

#Empty the django_migrations table:
delete from django_migrations;
#For every app, delete its migrations folder:
rm -rf <app>/migrations/
#Reset the migrations for the "built-in" apps:
python manage.py migrate --fake
#For each app run:
python manage.py makemigrations <app>.
#Take care of dependencies (models with ForeignKey's should run after their parent model).
Finally: python manage.py migrate --fake-initial
After that I ran the last command without the --fake-initial flag, just to make sure.

 In order to find objects and their documentation, pydoc imports the module(s) to be documented. Therefore, any code on module level will be executed on that occasion. Use an if __name__ == '__main__': guard to only execute code when a file is invoked as a script and not just imported.

Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the structure is determined from the succession of headings. However, this convention is used in Pythonâ€™s Style Guide for documenting which you may follow:

# with overline, for parts
* with overline, for chapters
=, for sections
-, for subsections
^, for subsubsections

def foo(a=[]):

Python novices would expect this function to always return a list with only one element: [5]. The result is instead very different, and very astonishing (for a novice):

>>> foo()
[5]
>>> foo()
[5, 5]
>>> foo()
[5, 5, 5]
>>> foo()
[5, 5, 5, 5]
>>> foo()def foo(a=[]):
